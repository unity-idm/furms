== End User support

Every user that signs into FURMS has access to her/his FURMS profile & settings view. For the users who have no additional roles, this is the only accessible view, others can activate it from the top-right view chooser.

User settings allows every FURMS user to check:

* personal information which is exposed to FURMS by the Fenix infrastructure,
* user's projects list.

{versionlimit} User settings will provide more functionality in subsequent FURMS releases, including management of personal SSH keys and site access details.
