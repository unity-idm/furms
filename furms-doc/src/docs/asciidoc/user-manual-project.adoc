== Project management

FURMS project groups users who work on a common topic and consume resources provided by sites and assigned by communities.

Each project must have a _project leader_, who is a formal representative and a responsible person. Besides this formal role, project has one or more administrators, who can manage the project in FURMS.

Project management in FURMS consists of two main operations:

- managing users who work within the project,
- managing access of project users to resources allocated to the project.  

What is more, FURMS collects resource usage information from sites on which resources are consumed. This information can be used to track budget consumption and its spread over time.

=== Managing users

Under the Users menu entry, project administrator can view, add and remove project users. Note that project administrator needs not to be (and does not become by default) a regular project user. Administrator can however assign him/her-self project user role with a dedicated action button. 


=== Project settings

Under the Settings menu entry, project administrator can control project details. Some of the settings are under control of the parent community and therefore are presented as read-only values.


=== Resource access

Users of a project do not access to each allocation automatically. Instead, the project administrator is responsible for granting (or removing) access to each individual allocation. This is controlled on the Resource access view. 

Note that there is one exception to that rule. Site sometimes define resources which are available to all users at the site. Such resources are available to all users at the site, and control of resource access is not possible for them as it is always enabled.

=== Resource allocations

Resource allocations view shows a table with all allocations that were assigned to the project by its community. Each allocation is specific to a site and a single resource offered by this site.

It is important to know that community assigned allocation needs to be acknowledged and installed by the site. In effect of this process, the site may decide to allocate less (or even more) resources than the community requested for the project. What is more site can allocate the resources in several portions, e.g. distributing a bigger allocation into several monthly or quarterly parts.

To see the resources which were actually assigned by the site, a row with community assigned allocation needs to be expanded. This is presented on the example below, where a single community allocation for 64 hours was assigned in two chunks, of 32 and 16 hours. It is possible that the TOPSITE will provide in future additional chunk, with remaining 16 hours.

=== Defining alarms

{versionlimit} This functionality is not available yet.

=== Managing project administrators

FURMS project can have multiple administrators. Each project administrator can add (and remove) other administrators from the "Site administrators" view.

NOTE: Project must have a single _project leader_ defined. Typically this is one of the administrators but this is not strictly necessary.  

{versionlimit} Adding project administrators is currently limited to users who has signed in to FURMS at least once.
