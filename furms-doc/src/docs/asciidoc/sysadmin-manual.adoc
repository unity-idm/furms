== FURMS architecture overview

FURMS system consists of two services:

* Unity-IdM: an existing open source software which covers:
** authentication
** user provisioning
** groups management (with persistence)
** user management including user attributes and group memberships (with persistence)
** notifications functionality

* The FURMS service
** a complete UI for the FURMS users (only sign-in and sign-up views will be hosted on Unity)
** communities, projects and sites management, 
** control and assignment of budgets
** accounting
** external REST API

The administrative control of the FURMS system is available via the dedicated FURMS service UI, however some rarely used system administration actions will require the use of Unity-IdM administrative UI. An example of such action is the modification of email message templates used for notifications sent by FURMS. Note that only the FURMS administrators will need to use Unity-IdM administrative UI, other types of users (e.g. site admins or community admins) will not have to use it.

The following figure shows high level overview of the interactions between FURMS system and FENIX infrastructure.

=== Unity-IdM

Unity-IdM is an existing software providing authentication and user management service. Unity-IdM allows its users to enable authentication to their web services using various protocols, with different configurations for many relaying parties. The actual authentication can be performed using the built-in, feature-rich users database or can be delegated to one of supported upstream identity providers.


The information obtained from upstream IdPs can be flexibly translated and merged with the local database (if needed) and re-exported using other protocols. Unity-IdM can authenticate both locally and using SAML and Oauth authentication protocols. Authentication can be performed against locally stored credentials or delegated to external service. 


The following figure shows the high level Unity-IdM architecture

More of the general information on Unity can be found at https://unity-idm.eu web page, while the reference documentation is available at the https://www.unity-idm.eu/support/ sub-page. 

== FURMS installation from scratch
This section describes how to install the FURMS system from scratch. The installation is done through Ansible scripts and covers installation of FURMS service as well as Unity-IdM service. Both services work closely together. 

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware requirements

Both services can be installed on a single machine, or on two separate ones. As the communication between the servers is intensive a single host installation may be preferred. 

* *Disk space*: installation of both services together requires less than 1GB of disk space. It is advised to reserve significantly more in order to preserve log files and multiple updates (each is installed in separate directory by default).
* *RAM*: minimum of 1GB of free memory _per each service_ must be reserved. It is advised to provide 4GB per service in order to handle heavy load.  
* *CPU*: there are no strict restrictions, however at least 2 cores per service are advised. Production environment with many users may make good use of a more powerful machine.

==== Java
FURMS system requires Java Runtime Environment. The version 11 is the supported Java version. Install JRE on host(s) where services are going to be run.

==== Ansible
Install Ansible tooling on the host which will control FURMS system through scripts. Follow the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/[Ansible installation guide].

==== Database
Install any recent version of PostgreSQL on the host of your choice. The setup of database requires creation of two databases each with a separate role (user) which is able to connect to the database. One database is utilized by FURMS service and the other for Unity-IdM. This information will be used later on in the Ansible group variable file to setup databases configuration during installation.

=== Broker
Install any recent RabbitMQ broker with support for AMPQ 0.9.1. The broker setup requires:

* configuration of the TLS in order to enable encryption on the protocol level,
* definition of the https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.html[RabbitMQ virtual host] utilized for the FURMS purposes,
* definition of the client user name and password with
** a connection rights to FURMS virtual host, 
** privileges to provision queues within this virtual host
** permissions to write messages to AMQP default exchange (`amq.default`)

The virtual host name, privileged client user name and a password, as well as public CA certificate which was used to sign credential for the broker are used later on in the Ansible group variable file to setup broker connection during installation.


NOTE: The broker service is considered as the infrastructure resource, however for demonstration purposes and ease of configuration, below is an example of `rabbitmq.conf` file with TLS support turned on.
```
listeners.ssl.default = 5671

ssl_options.cacertfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/ca_certificate.pem
ssl_options.certfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/server_certificate.pem
ssl_options.keyfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/server_key.pem
ssl_options.password = <put-keyfile-password>
ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = false
ssl_options.verify = verify_none
ssl_options.versions.1 = tlsv1.2
```
Please refer to the https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html[RabbitMQ TLS Support] guide for more informations.


==== Connection setup for site's local agent
The communication between FURMS and particular site is done through two queues which are declared by FURMS when FENIX administrator creates a site. Dedicated queue names consists of site's identifier and a special suffix:

* `<siteid>-site-pub` - queue is used by site to publish messages to FURMS
* `<siteid>-furms-pub` - queue is used by FURMS to publish message to the site

The site's identifier is visible on Site administrator's Settings page as 'Site Id'. When the Site Id is e.g. `ygmr6`, then the created queues names are:

* `ygmr6-site-pub`
* `ygmr6-furms-pub`

From Site's point of view, broker administrator must define:

* an exchange of `direct` type within FURMS virtual host with:
** name set to `<siteid>-site-pub` (note that an exchange and site publish queue names are the same),
** binding created, and configured to route messages with `<siteid>-site-pub` routing key to `<siteid>-site-pub` queue
* the client user name and password with a connection rights to FURMS virtual host, and privileges to:
** write messages to `<siteid>-site-pub` exchange,
** read messages from `<siteid>-furms-pub` queue,

NOTE: In order to setup a connection from site agent to broker, the aforementioned user name and password is required as well as the public CA certificate which was used to sign credential for the broker. This information needs to be handed over to the local site administrator in order to setup encrypted and authorized connection to FURMS through the broker. 

=== Installation best practices ===
There are two recommended configurations of FURMS system that can be used to install the services:

* behind HTTP proxy
* exposed directly

Depending upon which is selected, there are some ramifications on the configuration to be made.

==== HTTP proxy configuration
It is assumed that in this configuration the proxy has installed the certificates signed by legitimate authorities. In this case the FURMS system can be equipped with self-signed certificates. One pair of PKI credential for Unity-IdM and the other for FURMS Service. 

Note that for such configuration the truststore needs to be carefully prepared. The general rule of a thumb is that it must contain at least: 

* the public CA certificate which is at the top of the certificates chain used to sign Unity-IdM credential,
* the public CA certificate which is at the top of the certificates chain used to sign Central IdP credential.


==== Services exposed directly
In this configuration, both Unity-IdM as well as a FURMS service must be equipped with PKI credentials signed by legitimate authorities. The truststore can be configured to use the system one. On RHEL like system the default place of a trustore is ```/etc/pki/java/cacerts```, and on Ubuntu like systems  ```/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts```.


NOTE: In both setup cases, there are configuration options in the Ansible group variables file, that need to be properly filled according to your infrastructure setup ```*.advertisedHost```,  ```unity.proxyCount```. Please refer to the description of the variables in the following sections.

=== FURMS devops tools installation utility
In order to install the latest released FURMS devops tooling, use the `FURMS devops tools installation utility`.
Enter to the directory of your choice and run the following commands:
```
> export FURMS_ROOT_DIR=/home/furms-app/staging
> curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unity-idm/furms-devops/main/install-tooling/install_furms_devops_tooling.py -o $FURMS_ROOT_DIR/install_furms_devops_tooling.py
> chmod +x $FURMS_ROOT_DIR/install_furms_devops_tooling.py
```
=== FURMS Ansible scripts
Use the `FURMS devops tools installation utility` to install the latest Ansible scripts. 
Enter to the directory where the utility was installed, and execute the following:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ./install_furms_devops_tooling.py
Installation of latest FURMS devops tools into /home/furms-app/staging
Command finished successfully
> ls -l
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 furms-app furms-app   32 01-16 12:27 furms-devops-tooling -> furms-devops-tooling-1.0.0
drwxr-xr-x. 5 furms-app furms-app 4096 10-28 15:36 furms-devops-tooling-1.0.0
-rwxr-x---. 1 furms-app furms-app 3057 01-16 12:25 install_furms_devops_tooling.py
```
The aforementioned tool can be run at will, and the consecutive executions will update the FURMS Ansible scripts to the latest version.

=== Setup Ansible configuration files
Create the inventory and group variables files in the `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR` directory (where FURMS devops tooling was installed). You can base on the example files that are delivered with the Ansible tooling. 

With regards to the inventory file, depending upon whether you are going to install FURMS system components on local machine, or on remote hosts, there are two different example files prepared. If you intend to install components on a local machine, then use `inventory.local` file in the example below, otherwise use `inventory.remote` to have installation performed on remote hosts.
 
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> cp furms-devops-tooling/local-cfg-sample/inventory.local inventory  # or inventory.remote
> mkdir -p group_vars
> cp furms-devops-tooling/local-cfg-sample/group_vars/all.yml group_vars/
``` 
The following files should be copied to the current directory:

* ```inventory```
* ```group_vars/all.yml```

==== Inventory
Ansible can work against multiple machines in your infrastructure. It does this by selecting systems listed in Ansible’s inventory file. Make appropriate changes to the copied example of inventory file.

==== Group vars
All of the FURMS deployment settings are configured in the `all.yml` Ansible group file. The example of this file can be found now in `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR/group_vars/all.yml` file.

NOTE: The devops tooling provides also a file that is filled out with example values. A file sample demonstrates the configuration of FURMS system behind a proxy, please see `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR/furms-devops-tooling/local-cfg-sample/group_vars/all.yml.behind-proxy` for a reference.

=== Email templates configuration
FURMS utilizes Unity-IdM notification subsystem, therefore in order to setup email templates used by FURMS, administrator has to create the Unity-IdM configuration files, described in the next subsections, and put a reference to those in the Ansible group variables file.

==== Message templates configuration
This particular configuration file is parsed by Unity-IdM and defines all email template definitions. Below is the default content:

```
master-furms-header.subject.en=
master-furms-header.consumer=Generic
master-furms-header.type=HTML
master-furms-header.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/masterTemplate-furms-head.html

master-furms-footer.subject.en=
master-furms-footer.consumer=Generic
master-furms-footer.type=HTML
master-furms-footer.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/masterTemplate-furms-footer.html

policyAcceptanceNew.subject.en=Fenix policy document awaits acceptance
policyAcceptanceNew.consumer=UserNotification
policyAcceptanceNew.notificationChannel=default_email
policyAcceptanceNew.type=HTML
policyAcceptanceNew.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/policyAcceptanceNew.html

policyAcceptanceRevision.subject.en=Fenix policy document was updated
policyAcceptanceRevision.consumer=UserNotification
policyAcceptanceRevision.notificationChannel=default_email
policyAcceptanceRevision.type=HTML
policyAcceptanceRevision.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/policyAcceptanceRevision.html

invitationNew.subject.en=New role to accept
invitationNew.consumer=UserNotification
invitationNew.notificationChannel=default_email
invitationNew.type=HTML
invitationNew.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/invitationNew.html

registrationInvitation.subject.en=You have been invited to the FURMS app
registrationInvitation.consumer=InvitationWithCode
registrationInvitation.notificationChannel=default_email
registrationInvitation.type=HTML
registrationInvitation.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/registrationInvitation.html

invitationAccepted.subject.en=Invitation has been accepted
invitationAccepted.consumer=UserNotification
invitationAccepted.notificationChannel=default_email
invitationAccepted.type=HTML
invitationAccepted.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/invitationAccepted.html

invitationRejected.subject.en=Invitation has been rejected
invitationRejected.consumer=UserNotification
invitationRejected.notificationChannel=default_email
invitationRejected.type=HTML
invitationRejected.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/invitationRejected.html

applicationNew.subject.en=You have received new application
applicationNew.consumer=UserNotification
applicationNew.notificationChannel=default_email
applicationNew.type=HTML
applicationNew.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/applicationNew.html

applicationAccepted.subject.en=Application has been accepted
applicationAccepted.consumer=UserNotification
applicationAccepted.notificationChannel=default_email
applicationAccepted.type=HTML
applicationAccepted.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/applicationAccepted.html

applicationRejected.subject.en=Application has been rejected
applicationRejected.consumer=UserNotification
applicationRejected.notificationChannel=default_email
applicationRejected.type=HTML
applicationRejected.bodyFile.en=${CONF}/msgTemplates/applicationRejected.html
```

The path to this file shall be provided in the  `unity.msgTemplates.configuration` property value in the Ansible groups variable file. Note that there are couple of predefined message template definitions that must be preserved. The following template definitions are used by FURMS:

* `policyAcceptanceNew` - utilized to notify user about new policy document to accept,
* `policyAcceptanceRevision` - utilized to notify user that existing policy has been updated and awaits approval,
* `invitationNew` - utilized to send invitations to existing users who were invited to new roles,
* `registrationInvitation` - utilized to send invitations to create a new account in FURMS to prospective users,
* `invitationAccepted` - utilized to send information that particular user has accepted the invitation to new role, email is send to administrators of originating group as well as to the person who initiated the invitation,
* `invitationRejected` - utilized to send information that a user has rejected the invitation to new role, email is send to administrators of originating group as well as to the person who initiated the invitation,
* `applicationNew` - utilized to send information to particular project's administrators that a new user has applied for project membership,
* `applicationAccepted` - utilized to send information to a user, that her/his application to become member of a project, has been accepted by project administrator,
* `applicationRejected` - utilized to send information to a user, that her/his application to become member of a project, has been rejected by project administrator.  


Most of the configuration in the default message template file should not be changed.
It is recommended for system administrator to adjust the template subject only. 

==== Email template body files
Given the default template configuration file, FURMS system administrator has to create the following email template body files:

* `policyAcceptanceNew.html` - used by `policyAcceptanceNew` template definition, 
* `policyAcceptanceRevision.html` - used by `policyAcceptanceRevision` template definition,
* `invitationNew.html` - used by `invitationNew` template definition,
* `registrationInvitation.html` - used by `registrationInvitation` template definition,
* `invitationAccepted.html` - used by `invitationAccepted` template definition,
* `invitationRejected.html` - used by `invitationRejected` template definition,
* `applicationNew.html` - used by `applicationNew` template definition,
* `applicationAccepted.html` - used by `applicationAccepted` template definition,
* `applicationRejected.html` - used by `applicationRejected` template definition,
* `masterTemplate-furms-head.html` - header that can be utilized in body files of other HTML templates. In the resolved HTML email the `${include:master-furms-head}` tag is replaced with the header content,
* `masterTemplate-furms-footer.html`- footer that can be utilized in body files of other HTML templates. In the resolved HTML email the `${include:master-furms-footer}` tag is replaced with the footer content.

The path to the directory that stores the aforementioned HTML template files, shall be provided in the `unity.msgTemplates.files` property value in the Ansible groups variable file.

Example of `policyAcceptanceNew.html` file:

```
${include:master-furms-header}
<p>Dear User,</p>
<p>There is a new policy document awaiting your acceptance.</p>
<p>Please read the '${custom.name}' document available <a href="${custom.furmsUrl}">here</a>.
</p>
${include:master-furms-footer}

```

Email templates can use custom variables that define dynamic contents set by FURMS when sending notifications. The following table provides information about variables available in the particular HTML template.

|===
| HTML template file name | Variable | Description of resolved variable in template

.2+a|:hardbreaks:
policyAcceptanceNew.html

|===   


=== Install FURMS stack
Once configuration is finished, the following command will install the Unity-IdM as well as FURMS service:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/install-stack.yml
```

After installation the services are available in directory pointed out in `installDir`  property defined in `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR/group_vars/all.yml` file.


== FURMS system minor update procedure
Minor FURMS updates are performed whenever a newly installed software version differs only with the last number when compared to the currently installed one. Database backup is advised, however in the minor update case the risk is minimal - revision releases typically do not introduce database content migrations. The following steps provide example how to update the FURMS service into `1.0.1` version, assuming `1.0.0` is installed:

* <<Stopping FURMS stack,Stop FURMS stack>>.
* Install minor update:
** enter the `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR` directory,
** update the `furmsVersion` property defined in `group_vars/all.yml` file, change its value to `1.0.1` 
** execute: `ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/install-minor-update.yml`
* <<Starting FURMS stack,Start FURMS stack>>.

== Upgrade from 1.0 to 2.0 release

This section describes the FURMS 2.0 release installation steps basing on 1.0 release configuration. Note that it is required to drop the databases for FURMS service as well as for Unity-IdM, however all of the Ansible related configuration shall be reused.

* Install and configure RabbitMQ broker according to <<Broker,guidelines from this section>>.
* Drop PostgreSQL database used by Unity-IdM instance.
* Drop PostgreSQL database used by FURMS service instance.
* Update the FURMS Ansible scripts to the latest version, execute `./install_furms_devops_tooling.py` in the directory where tooling was installed.
* Update the trustStore file: add the public CA certificate which is at the top of the certificates chain used to sign Broker credential.
* Update your existing `groups_var/all.yml` Ansible configuration file:

** change the version of furmsVersion to `2.0.0`

** add the following configuration under the furmsServer:

	furmsServer: 
		...
	    broker:
	        host:                -- set -- me --
	        port:                -- set -- me --
	        username:            -- set -- me --
	        password:            -- set -- me --
	        virtualHost:         -- set -- me --
	    ui:
	        maxSessionInactivityInSeconds:     -- set -- me -- #optional: default 1800
	        secondsBeforeShowingLogoutWarning: -- set -- me -- #optional: default 120

* <<Install FURMS stack>>

== Upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 release

This section describes the FURMS 3.0 release installation steps basing on 2.0 release configuration. This procedure does not require dropping any of the databases, and all of the Ansible related configuration is reused.

* Make a backup of PostgreSQL database used by Unity-IdM instance.
* Make a backup of PostgreSQL database used by FURMS service instance.
* Update the FURMS Ansible scripts to the latest version, execute `./install_furms_devops_tooling.py` in the directory where tooling was installed.
* <<Stopping FURMS stack,Stop FURMS stack>>.
* Update your existing `groups_var/all.yml` Ansible configuration file:

** change the version of furmsVersion to `3.0.0`

** add the following configuration under the unity:

	unity: 
		...
	  mail:
	    from:                -- set -- me --
	    smtp:
	      host:              -- set -- me --
	      port:              -- set -- me --
	      username:          -- set -- me --
	      password:          -- set -- me --
	  msgTemplates:          # this section is optional, if not provided the default configuration is delivered
	    files:               -- set -- me --
	    configuration:       -- set -- me --

** To customize the default message templates used by FURMS to send email notifications, please refer to the <<Email templates configuration>> section.
* <<Install FURMS stack>>.
* Make sure that RabbitMQ broker is up and running.
* <<Starting FURMS stack,Start FURMS stack>>.

== Upgrade from 3.0 to 3.1 release

This section describes the FURMS 3.1 release installation steps basing on 3.0 release configuration. This release does not introduce any new Ansible configuration, so the installation straight forward.

* Make a backup of PostgreSQL database used by Unity-IdM instance.
* Make a backup of PostgreSQL database used by FURMS service instance.
* Update the FURMS Ansible scripts to the latest version, execute `./install_furms_devops_tooling.py` in the directory where tooling was installed.
* <<Stopping FURMS stack,Stop FURMS stack>>.
* Update your existing `groups_var/all.yml` Ansible configuration file and change the version of furmsVersion to `3.1.0`
* <<Install FURMS stack>>.
* Make sure that RabbitMQ broker is up and running.
* <<Starting FURMS stack,Start FURMS stack>>.

== Operating the system

=== Starting FURMS stack
Once FURMS stack has been installed, the following command starts the FURMS stack - Unity-IdM server as well as FURMS service:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/start-stack.yml
```

=== Stopping FURMS stack
At any time the FURMS stack can be stopped using the following command:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/stop-stack.yml
```

=== Runtime directories structure, log files

The following listing shows example directory structure after FURMS installation: 

```
./20210211-214739
./20210211-214739/furms-server -> furms-server-1.0.0
./20210211-214739/furms-server-1.0.0
./20210211-214739/furms-server-1.0.0/furms-server
./20210211-214739/unity -> unity-server-3.4.3
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/conf
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/bin
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/webContents
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/data
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/workspace
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/extra
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/lib
./20210211-214739/unity-server-3.4.3/conf-orig
./current -> 20210211-214739
./logs
./workspace
```

The ``workspace/`` directory can be ignored, it contains temporary installation data. The ``current`` symlink points to the currently active revision. It is especially relevant when there are more than one installation. There is also `logs` directory that contains log files from both, FURMS service as well as Unity-IdM.

Inside the ``current/`` directory there are both services installed. The runtime data like PIDs and other can be found there.

Note that it is not advised to perform reconfigurations in the installation directories. Such changes will be lost during subsequent update with use of Ansible.

=== Authentication to Unity console

Access to Unity administration console should not be in general required for running FURMS, it may be however convenient to diagnose problems or to perform advanced configuration actions.

Unity console is available at the configured address of Unity server:
``https://{{unity.advertisedHost}}/console``.

Login credentials are set to the ones from Ansible configuration: ``{{unity.initialAdminUsername}}`` and ``{{unity.initialAdminPassword}}``.
