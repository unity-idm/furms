= FURMS System architecture overview

FURMS system consists of two services:

* Unity-IdM: an existing open source software which covers:
** authentication
** user provisioning
** groups management (with persistence)
** user management including user attributes and group memberships (with persistence)
** notifications functionality

* The FURMS service
** a complete UI for the FURMS users (only sign-in and sign-up views will be hosted on Unity)
** communities, projects and sites management, 
** control and assignment of budgets
** accounting
** external REST API

The administrative control of the FURMS system is available via the dedicated FURMS service UI, however some rarely used system administration actions will require the use of Unity-IdM administrative UI. An example of such action is the modification of email message templates used for notifications sent by FURMS. Note that only the FURMS administrators will need to use Unity-IdM administrative UI, other types of users (e.g. site admins or community admins) will not have to use it.

The following figure shows high level overview of the interactions between FURMS system and FENIX infrastructure.

== Unity-IdM

Unity-IdM is an existing software providing authentication and user management service. Unity-IdM allows its users to enable authentication to their web services using various protocols, with different configurations for many relaying parties. The actual authentication can be performed using the built-in, feature-rich users database or can be delegated to one of supported upstream identity providers.


The information obtained from upstream IdPs can be flexibly translated and merged with the local database (if needed) and re-exported using other protocols. Unity-IdM can authenticate both locally and using SAML and Oauth authentication protocols. Authentication can be performed against locally stored credentials or delegated to external service.

== FURMS installation from scratch
This section describes how to install the FURMS system from scratch. The installation is done through Ansible scripts and covers installation of FURMS service as well as Unity-IdM service. Both services work closely together. 

=== Prerequisites

=== Java
FURMS system requires Java Runtime Environment. The version 11 is a minimal supported one. Install JRE on host(s) where services are going to be run.

==== Ansible
Install Ansible tooling on the host which will control FURMS system through scripts. Follow the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/[Ansible installation guide].

==== Database
Install any recent version of PostgreSQL on the host of your choice. The setup of database requires creation of two databases each with a separate role (user) which is able to connect to the database. One database is utilized by FURMS service and the other for Unity-IdM. This information will be used later on in the Ansible group variable file to setup databases configuration during installation.

=== Installation best practices ===
There are two recommended configurations of FURMS system that can be used to install the services:

* behind HTTP proxy
* exposed directly

Depending upon which is selected, there are some ramifications on the configuration to be made.

==== HTTP proxy configuration
It is assumed that in this configuration the proxy has installed the certificates signed by legitimate authorities. In this case the FURMS system can be equipped with self-signed certificates. One pair of PKI credential for Unity-IdM and the other for FURMS Service. 

Note that for such configuration the truststore needs to be carefully prepared. The general rule of a thumb is that it must contain at least: 

* the public CA certificate which is at the top of the certificates chain used to sign Unity-IdM credential,
* the public CA certificate which is at the top of the certificates chain used to sign Central IdP credential.


==== Services exposed directly
In this configuration, both Unity-IdM as well as a FURMS service must be equipped with PKI credentials signed by legitimate authorities. The truststore can be configured to use the system one. On RHEL like system the default place of a trustore is ```/etc/pki/java/cacerts```, and on Ubuntu like systems  ```/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts```.


NOTE: In both setup cases, there are configuration options in the Ansible group variables file, that need to be properly filled according to your infrastructure setup ```*.advertisedHost```,  ```unity.proxyCount```. Please refer to the description of the variables in the following sections.

=== FURMS devops tools installation utility
In order to install the latest released FURMS devops tooling, use the `FURMS devops tools installation utility`.
Enter to the directory of your choice and run the following commands:
```
> export FURMS_ROOT_DIR=/home/furms-app/staging
> curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unity-idm/furms-devops/main/install-tooling/install_furms_devops_tooling.py -o $FURMS_ROOT_DIR/install_furms_devops_tooling.py
> chmod +x $FURMS_ROOT_DIR/install_furms_devops_tooling.py
```
=== FURMS Ansible scripts
Use the `FURMS devops tools installation utility` to install the latest Ansible scripts. 
Enter to the directory where the utility was installed, and execute the following:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ./install_furms_devops_tooling.py
Installation of latest FURMS devops tools into /home/furms-app/staging
Command finished successfully
> ls -l
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 furms-app furms-app   32 01-16 12:27 furms-devops-tooling -> furms-devops-tooling-1.0.0
drwxr-xr-x. 5 furms-app furms-app 4096 10-28 15:36 furms-devops-tooling-1.0.0
-rwxr-x---. 1 furms-app furms-app 3057 01-16 12:25 install_furms_devops_tooling.py
```
The aforementioned tool can be run at will, and the consecutive executions will update the FURMS Ansible scripts to the latest version.

=== Setup Ansible configuration files
Create the inventory and group variables files in the `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR` directory (where FURMS devops tooling was installed). You can base on the example files that are delivered with the Ansible tooling. Taking into account the example from previous sections, execute the following commands: 
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> cp -r furms-devops-tooling/local-cfg-sample/* .
``` 
The following files should be copied to the current directory:

* ```inventory```
* ```group_vars/all.yml```

==== Inventory
Ansible can work against multiple machines in your infrastructure. It does this by selecting systems listed in Ansible’s inventory file. The example which can be used to manage FURMS system on a local machine, can be found now in `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR/inventory`. Aforementioned inventory file can be used as a starting point to prepare your target configuration. 

==== Group vars
All of the FURMS deployment settings are configured in the `all.yml` Ansible group file. The example of this file can be found now in `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR/group_vars/all.yml` file. The following table provides description of all configuration options.

=== Install FURMS stack
Once configuration is finished, the following command will install the Unity-IdM as well as FURMS service:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/install-stack.yml
```

After installation the services are available in directory pointed out in `installDir`  property defined in `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR/group_vars/all.yml` file.


=== Start FURMS stack
Once FURMS stack has been installed, the following command starts the FURMS stack - Unity-IdM server as well as FURMS service:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/start-stack.yml
```

=== Stop FURMS stack
At any time the FURMS stack can be stopped using the following command:
```
> cd $FURMS_ROOT_DIR
> ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/stop-stack.yml
```

== FURMS system minor update procedure
Minor FURMS updates are performed whenever a newly installed software version differs only with the last number when compared to the currently installed one. Database backup is advised, however in the minor update case the risk is minimal - revision releases typically do not introduce database content migrations. The following steps provide example how to update the FURMS service into `1.0.1` version, assuming `1.0.0` is installed:

* <<Stop FURMS stack>>
* Install minor update:
** enter the `$FURMS_ROOT_DIR` directory,
** update the `furmsVersion` property defined in `group_vars/all.yml` file, change its value to `1.0.1` 
** execute: `ansible-playbook -i inventory furms-devops-tooling/install-minor-update.yml`
* <<Start FURMS stack>>
